# ETL Process in Data Warehousing

## Introduction
This project focuses on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which is crucial for effective data management and data warehousing. The primary purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience in handling data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a data warehouse for analysis and reporting.

## Why is Data Warehouse Relevant?
Data warehousing is significant for data engineers as it allows for the consolidation of data from multiple sources into a single repository. This project provides practical experience in building and managing data warehouses, which is essential for making informed business decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.
